# FIX - Fractional Insurance Exchange

This project develops an insurance exchange, named FIX, for individuals to buy and sell insurance policies.

Unlike other blockchain based insurance services that allow only corporate insurers to provide insurance policies. FIX allows individuals to insure via fractionalizing insurance policies. 

For example, a life insurance policy with face value 1 million dollars seems too much for one individual to insure. But 1/10000 portion of this life insurance policy, which has face value equals $100, is acceptable to individual insurers. When an individual insurer has 100 fractional insurance policies like this, his or her portfolio would become diverse enough to become stable investment.

## Roles in FIX

There are 4 roles required for FIX to operate:
* Insured
* Insurer
* Identification Verifier
* Accident Verifier

In addition, some optional roles could largely faciliate the process:
* Data Service Provider
    * Data Provider
    * Data Analytic Solution
    * Scoring Entity
* Compliance Checker
* Insurance Brokerage
